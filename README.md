# Title: 
MODULE 1 CHALLENGE

## Overview and Origin:
This case study will focus on a mid market player in the payments processing space. 

* What is the name of the company?
Pay U (www.corporate.payu.com)

* When was the company incorporated?
2014

* Who are the founders of the company?
Jose Velez, Martin Schrimpff, Arjan Bakker, Grzegorz Brochocki, Nitin Gupta, Shailaz Nag

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
PayU is the result of multiple payment gateways in various regions of the world that have been acquired and brought into the PayU group.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
This company is a part of Prosus (www.prosus.com) which itself was spun out of Naspers Ltd. in 2019 to diversify away from South Africa and give investors more direct exposure to its broad portfolio of tech businesses. PayU is 98.8% owned by Prosus. With regard to how much funding they have received, their website indicates that despite having $100M in revenue, they did not become profitable until 2018, which means that they would have been funded by their parent company for 4 years before becoming profitable, which places the estimated funding they received in excess of $500M.

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
They are a global payment solutions provider, which is where they are generating revenue and where (as of 2018) they are profitable. However, the other areas in which they are active are credit solutions, local payments solutions, and investing in other fintech startups and mid-range organizations. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
To give an indication of their market size, they provide service in 50+ emerging markets, they process 10M financial transactions daily, they processed $55B payments in FY21, and they disbursed $130+M in consumer loans to date. On the investment side, they have invested $1B in other fintechs. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilise?)
An advantage they have is the fact that they are owned by a huge corporation (Prosus) who is owned by an even bigger multinational corporation (Naspers) which gives them access to funds and partnership opportunities facilitated via their parent company's existing business relationships and influence. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)
Applications and Data: JavaScript, PHP, Java, NGINX, C#, CSS3, Ruby, Golang, Objective-C, Akamai, Smarty
Utilities: Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager
DevOps: New Relic
Business Tools: Drupal, Acquia
Technology Benefit Claims: Single API with unlimited connectivity and flexibility; managing unexpected surges in activity and traffic without latency, smart routing, advance analytics dashboard, unified token vault, risk analysis and fraud detection, security and privacy, speedy integration 

## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Payments

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?
One of the biggest innovations has been the integration ability within multiple channels. 10 years ago payments were commonly processed via a single PoS device. Now they are processed in a multitude of digital and mobile transaction with new methods, platforms, and interfaces across both centralized and decentralized environments. Another change is the emergence and prevalence of international payments and the ability to transaction globally with related safety. This leads into another difference, which is the ability of emerging markets to offer payment processing. This will continue to be an area of growth in the years to come. (There have also been in change in wholesale payments, however since PayU is a retail payments provider, I have focused exclusively on the retail payments landscape.) In addition to increases in speed, reliability, and convenience within payment processing, the methods of payments processed have also changed from fiat to both fiat and crypto. In addition to the front end, user facing changes described above, there have also been changes in infrastructure and deployment (data, switching, system of records, tokenization) and middleware ecosystem (routing, analytics, risk, authorization, instruments). One example of back-end innovations is the growth of Payments as a Service (PaaS). 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
There are many. To name a few: Stripe, PayPal, Google Pay, Airwallex, Skrill, Amazon Pay, Paytm, AccessPay

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
One of the biggest impacts has been its globalization expansion and capture of emerging markets. One example of this is the recent acquisition (backed by Prosus) of BillDesk for US$4.7B. This gives them significant operational capacity with the Indian market. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
They measure users, number of transaction (per minute, hour, day, month, year), and the transaction amount total. By these metrics, PayU is in the mid range of operations and relatively successful. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Here is an indication of relative performance using transaction values:
PayU: $55 Billion in 2021
Google Pay: $110 Billion in 2019
Stripe: $350 Billion in 2020
PayPal: $1.25 Trillion in 2021

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
It seems this company falls short of competitors in two primary areas: customer experience and fees.
Firstly, I would advise this company to improve the customer's experience in the ares of usability, accessability, and ease of use. They could also initiate, verify, and onboard new users in a more streamlined and efficient manner as well as provide better issues management in dispute cases. 
Secondly, it seems this company is trying to increase market share by infiltrating or setting up solutions in emerging markets, therefore I would advise them to become more competitive with their fees as their volume increases. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
I think it would help with retention and being able to compete with the leaders in this area (for example, Stripe). 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilise?
With regard to improving the onboarding experience, they could imply facial recognition software to help in the verification process. Other fintechs and DeFi organizations have been using this to improve security and complete account security verifications faster (for example, Coinberry).

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
As their market share increases, they will not be able to maintain this verification process for increased onboarding volumes. Therefore, their already problematic customer experience will only become worse unless they introduce new technologies that would enable to them to complete security verifications faster and onwards users quicker.
